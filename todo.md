# Things to do in approximate order
[ ] Get current parcels/sites up in simple fact (don't worry about documenting all staging/silver models, especially things that will use raw column names). This will also be the proving ground for external materializations.
[ ] Get streets back
[ ] Convert macros for duckdb
[ ] Clean up ymls/docs
[ ] Work in 2024 legacy data
[ ] Figure out tax roll incorporation
[ ] Start on historical assessor data
